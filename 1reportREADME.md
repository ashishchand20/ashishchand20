ABSTRACT:-

This Courier Management System Project will have different modules. The login section will have login facility for the admin and for the user who will operate this system. While taking orders from its customers, it will take all the details of its customers who is placing the orders and all the details for the recipient such as its address, name, mobile number. During billing process system will generate a tracking id for their products. Through this tracking id, customers or its recipient will able to track their products from any location using internet. It will provide status of the product after placing orders within 1 minute.


It is now-a-days very important for the people to send or receive articles like 
imported furniture, electronic items, gifts, business goods and the like. People depend 
vastly on different transport systems which mostly use the manual way of receiving and 
delivering the articles. There is no way to track the articles till they are received and there 
is no way to  let the customer know what happened  in transit,  once he booked some 
articles.  In such a situation, we need a system which completely computerizes the cargo 
activities including time to time tracking of the articles sent. This need is fulfilled by 
Courier Management  System software  which  is online  software  for  the cargo 
management people that enables them to receive the goods from a source and send them 
to a required destination and track their status from time to time.

INTRODUCTION:-

This Courier Management System Project will have different modules. The login section will have login facility for the admin and for the user who will operate this system. While taking orders from its customers, it will take all the details of its customers who is placing the orders and all the details for the recipient such as its  address, name, mobile number. During billing process system will generate a tracking id for their products. Through this tracking id, customers or its recipient will able to track their products from any location using internet. It will provide status of the product after placing orders within 1 minute.

This Courier Management System Project will provide information recipient with following details:- where the current consignment is, till when it will reached its final destination, if any delay then reason of the delay, the route of current consignment, date of placing consignment, final date to reach its destination.

When the consignment will visit to the city office of destination, a message will be send to the recipient with delivery status confirmation. Then after getting this message its recipient can take its parcels by using their Track Id. When its recipient will receive their parcels, then this Track Id will   be   deleted   automatically   from   the   system   database   after   1   week   by   sending   final confirmation message to its recipient mobile number which will include information of Track Id, date of receiving and time along with greeting message for providing further service in future.

In modern age, as time increase, needs & requirements of the person are also increased. They want more facility & try to do their task quickly & within time. But they can not get all the things at nearest market or area, so they have to import the things from any place in the world. 

Within the country, the things can be imported through post service. But it consumes the time & sometimes problem of damage or missing occur. Where as in the international market, the one way is shipping. But it also requires more time.

The courier service is one of the solutions of these problems. It is used to send some things to any person in the world within time.





The courier company has number of branches, which are spread over the country or the world. So that when person wants to send things then he has to contact at nearest courier service branch. The courier company creates the schedule & gives internal/external services. The courier service work as destination office or source office. The source office branch receives the order means consignments & sends it to the destination courier branch. The company has certain rules according to the weight.

Using the courier service person can easily send his/her parcel to other person in the particular destination within the time. Now days, 50% of companies of the world uses the services of various courier company.

 

PROBLEM DEFINITION:-

People when transfer their products using any courier service wants to know whether their product has been shifted to their right place or not, if not then by what time it will be shifted and where it is now. Taking all this information manually is very difficult and time taking process. To handle all these activities include various processes and paper work from the management side also. 

MOTIVATION :-

To gain maximum business region, customer demands good service. So to make more profit and gain maximum business region, their administration must also have a system to tackle all these problems on time. Its administration can take immediate orders and provide a receipt which will include all the details of the products along with appropriate price to their customers. Thus saving time and eliminating line making process.


 WORKING OF EXIXTING MODEL:-

This system will have different modules. The login section will have login facility for the admin and for the user who will operate this system. While taking orders from its customers, it will take all the details of its customers who is placing the orders and all the details for the recipient such as its address, name, mobile number. During billing process system will generate a tracking id for their products. Through this tracking id, customers or its recipient will able to track their products from any location using internet. It will provide status of the product after placing orders within 1 minute. This system will provide information recipient with following details:- where the current consignment is, till when it will reached its final destination, if any delay then reason of the delay, the route of current consignment, date of placing consignment, final date to reach its destination. When the consignment will visit to the city office of destination, a message will be send to the recipient with delivery status confirmation. Then after getting this message its recipient can take its parcels by using their Track Id. When its recipient will receive their parcels, then this Track Id will   be   deleted   automatically   from   the   system   database   after   1   week   by   sending   final confirmation message to its recipient mobile number which will include information of Track Id,
date of receiving and time along with greeting message for providing further service in future.
FEATURES:-

These are the important features of the project Courier Management System:

• In computer system of the courier service computation of the rate is easily & quickly 
done.

• Computer system of the courier service provide fast access.

• If our documents or any consignment is missed then we can know it easily using the 
databases in the computer system of courier services.

• Using this computerized system, bill issued procedure becomes fast.

• In computer system the person has to fill the various forms & number of copies of the 
forms can be easily generated at a time.

• In computer system, it is not necessary to create the Manifest but we can directly print it, which saves our time.

•It contain better storage capacity.

•Accuracy in work.

•Easy & fast retrieval of information.

•Well designed reports.

•Decrease the load of the person involve in existing manual system.

•Access of any information individually.

•Work  becomes very speedy.

•Easy to update information.

 
Feasibility Study:


After doing the system study and analyzing all the existing or required functionalities of the system, the next task is to do the feasibility study for the project. All projects are feasible – given unlimited resources and infinite time. Feasibility study includes consideration of all the possible ways to provide a solution to the given problem. The proposed solution should satisfy all the user requirements and should be flexible
enough so that future changes can be easily done based on the future upcoming requirements.

A.	Economical Feasibility:

This is a very important aspect to be considered while developing a project. We decidedthe technology based on minimum possible cost factor. All hardware and software cost has to be borne by the organization. Overall we have estimated that the benefits the organization is going to receive from the proposed system will surely overcome the initial costs and the later on running cost for system.

B.	Technical Feasibility:

This included the study of function, performance and constraints that may affect the
ability   to   achieve   an   acceptable   system.   For   this   feasibility   study,   we   studied   complete functionality to be provided in the system, as described in the System Requirement Specification (SRS), and checked if everything was possible using Visual Basic 6.0 and MS Access.

C.	Operational Feasibility:

No doubt the proposed system is fully GUI based that is very user friendly and all inputsto be taken all self-explanatory even to a layman. Besides, a proper training has been conducted to let know the essence of the system to the users so that they feel comfortable with new system. As far our study is concerned the clients are comfortable and happy as the system has cut down their loads and doing. 









SYSTEM REQUIREMENT:-

 1.VISUAL STUDIO:- Microsoft Visual Studio is an IDE made by
      Microsoft and used for different types of software development such as 
      computer programs, websites, web apps, web services, and mobile   
      apps. It contains completion tools, compilers, and other features to 
      facilitate the software development process. It should be installed with
      different libraries like tkinkter, pandas, etc.


  2.MY SQL:- A database is a separate application that stores a 
     collection of data. Each database has one or more distinct APIs for
     creating, accessing, managing, searching and replicating the data it
     holds. MySQL is a fast, easy-to-use RDBMS being used for many small 
     and big businesses. MySQL is developed, marketed and supported by 
     MySQL AB, which is a Swedish company. It is very helpful to store data.
